# How to Use the Recurrence Selector in TaskSwiper

The **Recurrence Selector** allows you to set up repeating tasks based on your preferences. Follow the steps below to configure recurrence for your tasks:

## 1. Choose a Recurrence Frequency
- Tap the dropdown menu labeled **"Repeat Task"**.
- Select one of the following options:
    - **Daily** â€“ Task repeats every set number of days.
    - **Weekly** â€“ Task repeats on selected days of the week.

## 2. Select Specific Days (Only for Weekly Recurrence)
- If you choose **Weekly**, a set of weekday buttons will appear.
- Tap the days when you want the task to repeat (e.g., **Mon, Wed, Fri**).
- Tap again to deselect a day.

## 3. Set the Interval
- Enter a number in the **"Repeat Every (days/weeks)"** field.
- This defines how often the task repeats. Examples:
    - Enter **1** for daily recurrence.
    - Enter **2** for every two weeks (if "Weekly" is selected).

## 4. Set a Reminder Time (Optional)
- Tap the **"Pick Time"** button.
- Choose the time when you want the task to occur.
- The selected time will be displayed.

## 5. Automatic Updates
- Any changes you make update the recurrence settings automatically.
- If you want to remove recurrence, unselect **Repeat Task**.

By following these steps, you can ensure your tasks repeat at the right times! ðŸš€
